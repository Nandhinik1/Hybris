Difference between calculate(order) and recalculate(order) in SAP Hybris calculationService:

calculationService.calculate(order): Efficient, recalculates only what’s necessary
  Purpose: 
    This method calculates the given order and all its entries only if they haven’t been calculated yet or if the order has been modified.
  Behavior: 
    It fetches prices, taxes, and discounts for uncalculated or modified entries only. Entries that are already calculated and unchanged remain as they are.
  Use Case: 
    Use this method when you want to ensure that all necessary calculations are performed without recalculating everything from scratch. It’s efficient for orders where only some parts need recalculating.

calculationService.recalculate(order): Comprehensive, recalculates everything
  Purpose: 
    This method recalculates the entire order and all its entries, regardless of their current state.
  Behavior: 
    It recalculates all prices, taxes, and discounts for the entire order, ensuring that everything is up-to-date.
  Use Case: 
    Use this method when you need to ensure that the entire order is recalculated, such as after significant changes that affect the whole order
