Interceptors:
Mdels in Hybris are representation of database tables and we use to save data to db and load from db

Models has its own lifecycle managed by *ModelService* eg., Save,load,prepare,remove,validate 

Five ModelService:

1. InitDefualtsInterceptor :

Called when we want to fill the data by default.called when we call modelService.create() method or modelService.initDefaults()

2. PrepareInterceptor:

Called before saving a data and after the ValidateInterceptor got called

  Used to add values to model or modify the existing ones

3. ValidateInterceptor :

 Called before saving a data and after PrepareInterceptor prepares the data

Use to validate the values, if any values are not correct then through interuptorException

4. LoadInterceptor :

   Called when we retrieve the data from database. We can use this modify the retrieved model value if required

5. RemoveInterceptor:

   Called before removing or deleting a data from database.

   We can use "remove interceptor whenever we need to remove models that are related to the model but are not in the

mmodel context."
